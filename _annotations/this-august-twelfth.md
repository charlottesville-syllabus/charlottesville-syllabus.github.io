Straughn writes about how the increased police presence in Charlottesville poses a threat to the activists, protesters and the community in general. Law enforcement officials have a history of hostile and unethical behaviors towards protestors, and during the white supremacy rally, they did little to nothing to protect Charlottesville against the KKK and other groups. Therefore, distrust and hesitation to welcome police presence is historically well-founded.
