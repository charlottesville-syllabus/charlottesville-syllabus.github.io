This commentary presents the unraveling of the white supremacy rally. The activists in the piece explain, in part, why Charlottesville was the ideal location for a rally, and more importantly how the events of August 11 and 12 changed the image of Charlottesville as an pretty, happy, college town. The authors suggests that as the town moves forwards towards equity, truth and love, it needs to acknowledge the racial divide and remember that Love will trump Hate.
