This open letter was written by an UVA alumni who is current an english associate professor at Louisville University. The alumnus wrote about their feelings of disgust and disappointment with the events that occured in Charlottesville during the weekend of August 12. She advised that the UVa community should use this aftermath as an opportunity to ensure that its communities of color are safe.
