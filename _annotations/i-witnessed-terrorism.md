Charlottesville BLM organizer David Straugh’s moving, personal account of the events on August 11–12, from his experiences being besieged at St. Paul’s church Friday Night, participating in the counter-protests at Emancipation, celebrating the apparent victory over the White supremacists afterward, and then witnessing the horror and trauma of the tragic terrorist attack which took Heather Heyer’s life and injured 19 others.
